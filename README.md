# Django-Api-for-census-application

The project is for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which is going to be used to do a census of members and priests ( which will be done via the flutter app by the data collectors ) and manage the collected data via the web admin dashboard. I used Django REST API to do all the back-end jobs. you can check it out on "mh.eotcwestarsi.org" { user name: admin pass:12345678 } and since it is a desktop-first web try to use laptop or desktop or turn on the desktop mode in your mobile. I can email you the apk file or the pictures of the flutter app.

And This specific Django program is used to create an API and some of the variable names in the code may confuse you since Ethiopia doesn't use English as the official language, especially for the church services. I just try to write them using English letters which may don't give a sense for non-Amharic-speaking fellows.

And I am new to GitHub also new to collaborating on a project remotely I do create this repo for you guys Solid Solutions. hope you will give me the chance to get this experience.

Yet I am a good communicator, I am a fast learner and I am very good at problem-solving. I can come up with efficient and effective solutions on time. Also I believe i have a good imagination which helps me to see things from a different angle and also understand others ideas correctly.

Thanks a lot for your time.
